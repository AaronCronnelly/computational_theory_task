# Computational Theory 2024/2025

This repository contains solutions for the assessment tasks in the **Computational Theory** module at Atlantic Technological University.  
All tasks are implemented using Python and presented in a single Jupyter Notebook: `tasks.ipynb`.

---

## 📘 Overview

The assessment explores a range of topics including:

- Bit-level operations and logic
- Hash functions and SHA256 internals
- Prime number algorithms and fractional bit extraction
- Turing Machine simulation
- Sorting algorithms and complexity analysis

Each task is documented with explanations, code, and tests to demonstrate understanding of theoretical concepts through practical implementation.
